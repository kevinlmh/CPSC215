The first example.
Elements in preorder: []
Inserting * as the root.
Elements in preorder: [*]
Inserting 2 as the left child of *.
Elements in preorder: [*, 2]
Inserting + as the right child of *.
Elements in preorder: [*, 2, +]
Inserting 6 as the left child of +.
Elements in preorder: [*, 2, +, 6]
Inserting 5 as the right child of +.
Elements in preorder: [*, 2, +, 6, 5]

The second example.
Inserting in preorder: - / * + 3 1 3 + - 9 5 2 + * 3 - 7 4 6
Elements in preorder: [-, /, *, +, 3, 1, 3, +, -, 9, 5, 2, +, *, 3, -, 7, 4, 6]
Elements in postorder: [3, 1, +, 3, *, 9, 5, -, 2, +, /, 3, 7, 4, -, *, 6, +, -]
